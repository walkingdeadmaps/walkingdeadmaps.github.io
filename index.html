	 <H3>This website is a collection of information from various sources and my own research into the filming locations for the AMC TV series, The Walking Dead.</H3>
	 <BR>
	  <div align="center"><img src="gailnme2.jpg" border="1" color="#C0C0C0" title="That's myself with GALE ANNE HURD, at the Waking Dead Caf�, in Senoia, GA."></div>
	  <BR>
	  <H3>I first became interested in the show right from the very start of Season 1, and 
	  when I was planning a vacation to Florida (I live in the UK) way back in 
	  February 2012, I thought it would be a great idea to travel up to Georgia for a 
	  few days to visit the filming locations for the show.<BR><BR>
That was when I first found out about the Walking Dead Locations website, and the website creator - Brian Holland.<BR><BR>
Brian was instrumental in me deciding to actually make the trip to Georgia - his 
enthusiasm for the show and his knowledge of the locations made that first 
visit a most interesting experience - so much so that I have visited Georgia numerous times over the following years!<BR><BR></H3>

	  <BR>
	  <H3>My visits to Georgia over recent years have not been only because of the 
	  filming locations, but also because Georgia is such an interesting place to visit - 
	  the countryside is a pleasure to see, and the people I've met on my travels have been so friendly - no doubt the famous Southern hospitality!</H3>

	  <BR>
	  <H3>Note: As this website was originally set up as a resource for myself only, it does 
	  not go into any depth about the various filming locations. The descriptions 
	  were sufficient for myself, due to my acquired knowledge, to be able to utilise 
	  the information directly from my smartphone, when out and about visiting 
	  various locations in Georgia.</H3>
	  <H3>November 2022: Having reached the end of 'The Walking Dead' (AMC TV series), I think that it's time to acknowledge the fine work done by Mike Riley and the Stalwart Films team, and also to Scott Tigchelaar and the Raleigh Studios, for the actual filming locations. Also not forgetting the residents of Georgia for putting up with the inconvenience that the filming may have had on their daily activities. I recall my visits to Georgia - Atlanta, Senoia, Haralson, Griffin, Newnan, Grantville, and of course the wonderful countryside and people - with great fondness. Thank you all!</H3><BR><BR>
